Mercurial Commit Hook to Asana
===============================

I like processes that provide free benefits and side affects that increase productivity. One of those is the ability to add commit information to the ticket / issue. This is accomplished through a commit hook that will submit the commit message, changeset information and the files touched to the asana ticket in question.
